Implement your criminal and student strategies in `criminal.py` and `student.py` respectively. Ensure that your criminal strategy inherits `BaseCriminal` and that your student strategy inherits `BaseStudent`.


Modify game parameters (e.g. which students, which criminals to play) in `game.py` at the bottom of the file (under `if __name__ == "__main__":`).




For Death Run, the strategy you wish to submit must reside in the BaseCriminal and BaseStudent classes; these classes are what you submit. For example, with the starter random strategies, you would submit:


class BaseCriminal():
   def __init__(self, edge_list, begin, ends):
       pass


   def strategy(self, edge_updates, vertex_count, budget):
       pass




for criminal and


class BaseStudent():
   def __init__(self, edge_list, begin, ends):
       pass


   def strategy(self, edge_updates, vertex_count, current_vertex):
       pass


for student.
